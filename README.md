# Investigating-Gapminder-World-dataset
This report is an exploration of data on countries around the world. Gapminder World has collected a variety of data on how people live their lives across the globe. This report will try to identify trends in the following datasets:

__Life expectancy__ - The average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortality rates stayed the same

__Happiness score (WHR)__ - Measured using the Cantril life ladder which is explained below

__The income per person__- GDP/capita with inflation adjusted to 2011 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

__The unemployment rate__ for individuals 15 years and over

__Working hours per week__ - Calculated by the total amount of yearly working hours divided by 52 weeks

### Cantril Life Ladder Method
It is the national average response to the question of life evaluations asking the following question: "Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst life for you. On which stepof the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?" The dataset expresses the answers as a percentage

### The questions to explore are as follows:
1. Does a higher income lead to a higher life expectancy?
2. Does a higher unemployment rate lead to a lower life expectancy?
3. Does a higher hours worked per week lead to a higher life expectancy?
4. Does a higher hours worked per week lead to a happier nation?
5. Does a higher income mean a nation is more happy?
6. Does a higher unemployment rate mean a nation is less happy?
